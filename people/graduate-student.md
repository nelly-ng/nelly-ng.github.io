**Jeongrak Son**

I am a PhD student at NTU, Singapore working in Nelly Ng's group. My PhD study aims to understand how auxiliary systems can enhance quantum information processing tasks, with the goal of leveraging this understanding to design improved protocols, particularly within resource theories and quantum algorithms. Highlights of my works include: closure of the gap between different thermodynamic resource theories using catalysis, establishing a no-go theorem for preparation-noise-robust catalysis applicable to a general class of resource theories, and proposing a quantum version of dynamic programming.

Before I came to Singapore, I worked as a research assistant at PCS IBS, Korea, during my Bachelor's degree studies at Seoul National University and for a short time after graduation. My research there focused on the role of measurement strategies in quantum thermodynamics. 

Outside of physics, I enjoy watching films where not much happens. I occasionally write about films on my personal website, and some of my reviews have been featured in Exposure (in-house publication of NTU film society) and Asian Cinema Digest (Asian Film Archive's monthly newsletter). I love talking about films with anyone, but I might secretly judge you for your taste.
