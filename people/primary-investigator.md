I started out as an undergrad in Physics at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. When I first learned quantum information theory, I was fascinated by its implications for real-world problems such as cryptography and communication. This led me to work with Prof. Stephanie Wehner for several years at the Centre for Quantum Technologies, Singapore. Later on, I did my PhD with Stephanie at the QuTech institute, Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands.

During my PhD, I worked on the subject of Quantum Thermodynamics, where I used quantum information theory as a toolkit to develop a framework of thermodynamics suited for nanoscale quantum systems. After my PhD, and a short-term visit in the ANU Quantum Optics group; I moved to Berlin and started a post-doc position, as an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellow in the group of Prof. Jens Eisert.

 
Finally, in November 2020, I return to Nanyang Technological University as a Nanyang Assistant Professor! Problems in quantum information and quantum thermodynamics continue to fascinate me, and I am also increasingly focused on their applications in many-body physics. If you also have a passion for the above areas of research, join me as I start to build my group in Singapore!
