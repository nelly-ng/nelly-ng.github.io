I started out as an undergrad in Physics at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. When I first learned quantum information theory, I was fascinated by its implications for real-world problems such as cryptography and communication. This led me to work with Prof. Stephanie Wehner for several years at the Centre for Quantum Technologies, Singapore. Later on, I did my PhD with Stephanie at the QuTech institute, Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands.

During my PhD, I worked on the subject of Quantum Thermodynamics, where I used quantum information theory as a toolkit to develop a framework of thermodynamics suited for nanoscale quantum systems. I approached these problems largely in the framework of quantum resource theories, but was also always interested in finding common ground with complementary frameworks, and seeking convergence with experimentalist collaborators. 

After my PhD, and a short-term visit in the ANU Quantum Optics group; I moved to Berlin and started a post-doc position, as an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellow in the group of Prof. Jens Eisert. My time there was fruitful: besides continuing to hone my study of quantum resource theories, I started working with the Atomchip group of JÃ¶rg Schmiedmayer on 1-dimensional Bose gases as a platform of witnessing quantum thermodynamic behaviour. I got attracted to the humble, down-to-earth, but non-trivial problems of how to reliably reconstruct quantum fields in such complex systems. A friendly collaborative relationship persists to this day.

In November 2020, I returned to Nanyang Technological University as a Nanyang Assistant Professor. Problems in quantum information and quantum thermodynamics continue to fascinate me. Even after a decade of venturing in quantum resource theories, I'm often humbled and inspired by how much I have still to learn. 

Fun (but rather predictable) fact: heavy coffee addict ;)
