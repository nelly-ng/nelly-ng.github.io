**Marek Gluza** 

Marek is a Research Fellow, and previously Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at SPMS, and is developing new eigenstate approximation quantum algorithms stemming from double-bracket flows. He is a co-author of publications on a variety of subjects: computational complexity of tensor networks, foundations of statistical mechanics, matrix analysis applied to neutrino physics, many-body localization, holography, quantum field thermal machines, fidelity witnessing, and quantum state tomography of phonons or cold atoms. He believes that our most important challenge on the way towards achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation is, ironically, the man-made climate change. When playing chess with the white pieces he always opens with 1. b3 and he would be happy to play with you.

**Ray Ganardi**

Hi, my name is Ray, and I like resource theories. I also like coffee too :D [website](https://ray.ganardi.xyz)
