**Tiang Bi Hong** was a physics and math undergrad at Nanyang Technological University. Within the inQ epsilon-neighbourhood, He is working with Jeongrak and Marek on quantum algorithm, and with Taufiq on 1D Bose–Einstein condensate quantum simulator. When not chasing quantum curiosities, he enjoys playing Go and Sudoku—because even Schrödinger’s cat needs a  purr-fect break :)

**Khanh Uyen Giang (Kay)** 

I'm a Project Officer at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working at the intersection of theory, numerics, and experiment. My research spans quantum thermodynamics, many-body physics, and open quantum systems. I'm currently involved in two interdisciplinary projects at NTU: collaborating with Marek on quantum algorithms for superconducting qubit platforms, and with Taufiq on tomographic reconstruction of bipartite systems following a quench.

Outside the lab, I enjoy baking, watercolour painting, and clay pottery. I'm always eager to learn something new — lately, that’s been German and ice-skating.
