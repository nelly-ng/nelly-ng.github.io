**Tiang Bi Hong** 

Bi Hong was a physics and math undergrad at Nanyang Technological University. Within the inQ epsilon-neighbourhood, He is working with Jeongrak and Marek on quantum algorithm, and with Taufiq on 1D Bose–Einstein condensate quantum simulator. When not chasing quantum curiosities, he enjoys playing Go and Sudoku—because even Schrödinger’s cat needs a  purr-fect break :)

**Khanh Uyen Giang (Kay)** 

I'm a Project Officer at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working at the intersection of theory, numerics, and experiment. My research spans quantum thermodynamics, many-body physics, and open quantum systems. I'm currently involved in two interdisciplinary projects at NTU: collaborating with Marek on quantum algorithms for superconducting qubit platforms, and with Taufiq on tomographic reconstruction of bipartite systems following a quench.

Outside the lab, I enjoy baking, watercolour painting, and clay pottery. I'm always eager to learn something new — lately, that’s been German and ice-skating.

** Xiaoyue Li (Sam) **

I arrived in Singapore in 2018, completely unaware of my academic inclinations. Amid that uncertainty, I began my undergraduate studies in Engineering Science and Mathematics at the National University of Singapore. It wasn’t until my final-year project with Prof. Steven Touzard at the Centre for Quantum Technologies that I discovered a fascination with quantum information and quantum optics.

Drawn by the elegance of mathematical formulations and the ingenuity of quantum algorithms, I joined In.Q as a research assistant after graduating in 2023, working with Dr. Marek Gluza on Double-Bracket Quantum Algorithms.

Building on this momentum, I am now pursuing a Master’s degree in Physics, hoping to deepen the theoretical foundations that first inspired me—and after that, we’ll see where the journey leads!
