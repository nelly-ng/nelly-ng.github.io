title: "Entanglement Battery Unlocks Lossless Quantum State Conversions~"
---

    <p>
Researchers have long faced a challenge: how to convert one form of entanglement into another without loss. Entanglement—a special form of correlations between particles—is essential for tasks like quantum communication and quantum computing. Until now, transformations between noisy entangled states were thought to be inherently inefficient, always losing some entanglement along the way, much like energy lost to friction in mechanical engines. </p>
    <p>
Our research overturns this belief by showing that these conversions can, in principle, be done without any loss. The key is a new concept we introduce called an “entanglement battery”—a tool that temporarily stores and supplies entanglement, making the process fully reversible. What’s new is that we prove this reversibility works for all quantum states, including messy, real-world ones, and we give a simple formula to predict how much entanglement is exchanged. This breakthrough resolves a long-standing question in quantum information science. Beyond entanglement, our approach can be adapted to other quantum resources, opening new directions for research and practical applications.
