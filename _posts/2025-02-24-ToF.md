title: "An in-depth study on ToF measurements and their reliability"
---

Iâ€™m super pleased to share my first paper with Taufiq, our youngest PhD student in the group :) While studying Bose gases, we realized that longitudinal expansion plays a bigger role in interferometric phase measurements than usually considered. Our paper discusses this correction and how it can improve phase extraction methods in cold-atomic quantum simulators. Check it out on arXiv!

Update: this paper has since been published on [Scipost](https://scipost.org/10.21468/SciPostPhys.18.2.065). It's our first Scipost paper!
