title: "A hierarchy of thermal processeses collapse under catalysis!"
---

Exciting news! Jeongrak and Nelly puts out a second paper together, on their favourite subject -- catalysis. While tackling Jeongrak's first PhD project, we couldn't resist pondering how catalysis might shake up the hierarchy of thermal processes. The answer turned out to be delightfully straightforward! Dive into the fun details by checking out [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13020).

Update: The work has since been published in Quantum Sci. Technol. 10, 015011 (2024)
