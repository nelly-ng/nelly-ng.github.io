title: "A hierarchy of thermal processeses collapse under catalysis!"
---

Exciting news! My second paper with Jeongrak is out. While tackling his first project, we couldn't resist pondering how catalysis might shake up the hierarchy of thermal processes, and the answer turned out to be delightfully straightforward! Dive into the fun details by checking out our paper on arXiv:2303.13020.

Update: The paper has since been published in Quantum Sci. Technol. 10, 015011 (2024)
