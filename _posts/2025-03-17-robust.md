title: "Robust Catalysis and Resource Broadcasting: the possible and the impossible"
---

After a long time of working with catalysis, we became increasingly aware and appreciative of the problem that catalysts are highly fine-tune and fragile. Jeongrak, Ray, Seokhyung and Nelly became convinced that it's time to consider more seriously the robust uses of catalysis. We're so happy to share the [first step](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06900) we've made towards this! We've made good new friends (Francesco Buscemi and Shintaro Minagawa) in the process too, and enjoyed visiting each other.

This work was presented at Quantum Resources 2025 as an invited talk.
