title: "Robust Catalysis and Resource Broadcasting: the possible and the impossible"
---

After working on catalysis for so many years, we finally turned our heads to address the problem of fine-tuning and fragility in such processes. I'm happy to share the [first step](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06900) we've made towards this! 

This work was presented at Quantum Resources 2025 as an invited talk.
