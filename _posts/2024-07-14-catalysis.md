title: "Catalysis in Quantum Information Theory published in Review on Modern Physics"
---

Finally after 1.5 years of meeting weekly over Zoom, and a wonderful week in Hannover together, Patryk, Henrik and Nelly (aka, the catalyst fan club) completed our review on catalysis in quantum information theory! We combined forces and strived to present a balanced, complete perspective on the various categories of catalysis, together with the common techniques used in the field. 

As a first-timer in writing a review paper, we were always kind of anxious if we would miss something major in the vast amount of literature on this subject. Fortunately, the refereeing process was super smooth and people seemed to appreciate the work! Check out

for a concise guide and a one-stop resource (pun intended) for anyone new to catalysis!

Nelly represented the team in an interview with APS Magazine: <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read it here!</a>
