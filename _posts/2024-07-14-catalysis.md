title: "Catalysis in Quantum Information Theory published in Review on Modern Physics"
---

Finally after 1.5 years of meeting weekly over Zoom, and a wonderful week in Hannover together, we completed our review on catalysis in quantum information theory! Patryk and Henrik were wonderful to work with, and I enjoyed our "catalyst fan club" gatherings very much :)

The refereeing process was super smooth; check out 
<a href="https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.96.025005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our article</a>

for a concise guide and a one-stop resource (pun intended) for anyone new to catalysis!

Nelly represented the team in an interview with APS Magazine: <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read it here!</a>
