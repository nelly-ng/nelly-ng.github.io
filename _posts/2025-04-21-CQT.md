title: "Nelly rejoins CQT as Fellow today"
---

Nelly's first encounter with the Centre for Quantum Technologies was in 2011, when she signed on for a 3-month summer internship with Stephanie Wehner to work on bit commitment in the noisy-storage model. Since then, CQT has became an academic home for the next 5-6 years, up to the end of her PhD in the Netherlands. The support and community here has always encouraged and inspired her. Today, she happily announces her homecoming to CQT as Fellow, and looks forward to the years ahead as a proud member of the CQT family!
