      During his first project working on understanding the reliability of ToF measurements, Taufiq found himself asking what else can be reconstructed. Can we tease more information out of these snapshots of interfering Bose gases? Eventually we realized that by simply inverting a continuity equation, the total phase fluctuations -- not only relative phases -- and their correlations can also be inferred...

      The elegant and simple theoretical analysis was carried out and verified by both numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations together with the Atomchip group. Read more about it in our latest publication at <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.7.L022031">PRR</a>! We're hoping that this new tool gives us a way to witness more cool new physics for these ultracold gases~
