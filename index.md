We are a research group based at the Nanyang Technological University of Singapore. Our research interests lie in the intersection of information theory and quantum physics, with a main focus on the fundamental limits of manipulating quantum resources. We explore questions in quantum thermodynamics, quantum measurements, and resource theories, with particular interest in phenomena such as catalysis, coherence, and irreversibility.

in.Q officially stands for information & quantum.
It also stands for the spirit of scientific "inquiry", which is the curious wonder as we go about understanding the world.
Group members are called the inQlings, reminiscent of a literary group that gave us writers like Tolkien and Lewis.
