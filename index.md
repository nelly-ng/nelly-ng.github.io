We are a research group based at the Nanyang Technological University of Singapore. Our research interests lie in the intersection of information theory and quantum physics, with a main focus on fundamental limits of manipulating quantum resources. We are motivated by foundational questions in quantum thermodynamics, measurements, and resource theories; with a focus on coherence, catalysis, and irreversibility. Occasionally we discover how our work can be useful for quantum information-processing tasks ;) Our central aim, however, lies in the systematic development of rigorous frameworks and entropic toolsâ€”often within, but not limited to, the setting of quantum resource theories.

in.Q officially stands for information & quantum.
It also stands for the spirit of scientific "inquiry", the curious wonder as we go about understanding the world.
Group members are called inQlings, reminiscent of a literary group that gave us writers like Tolkien and Lewis. 

We welcome highly motivated students and collaborators with a strong background in mathematics or theoretical physics, who are drawn to the structural and mathematical aspects of quantum theory. While our work may not always align with fast-moving trends, we seek to advance fundamental understanding and contribute to the intellectual foundations of quantum information theory. If you value conceptual clarity and mathematical reasoning, we invite you to explore our research.
